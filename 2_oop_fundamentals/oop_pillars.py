# 1. Pillars of OOP

"""
    OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to
    represent data and methods. The four main pillars of OOP are Encapsulation, Abstraction,
    Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
"""

# 1.1 Abstraction
"""
    Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the
    essential features of the object. It helps in reducing complexity and increases efficiency.
"""

flight_reservation = FlyReservation("Boeing 747", 400)

flight_simulator.take_off()
flight_reservation.book_seat()

# 1.2 Encapsulation
"""
    Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data and methods into a single unit, i.e., a class.
    It restricts direct access to some of the object's components and can prevent the accidental
    modification of data. This is typically done using access modifiers like private, protected,
    and public.

# 1.3 Inheritance
"""
    Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class inherits properties and behavior (methods) from
    an existing class. The existing class is called the "base" or "parent" class, and the new
    class is called the "derived" or "child" class. Inheritance promotes code reusability and
    establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.

# 1.4 Polymorphism
"""
    Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon,
    even if they share the same name. It allows for methods to be used interchangeably, making
    code more flexible and easier to maintain.
